\noindent\textbf{Assignment 2, Due Monday Jan 23, 11:00 AM.}
\vskip.15in


The main goal of this part of the class is to get familiar with the
mechanics of working with series and complex numbers. So, this
assignment includes many short problems. The selection below is a good
one to get you acquainted with the techniques. The starred problems
are the ones you're required to turn in (there are ten of them).

\noindent\S1.10: 1*,2*,3,4,5 \\
\S1.12: 1* \\
\S1.13: 5ab, 7ab*, 9ab, 10ab, 20* \\
\S1.14: 3* \\
\S1.15: 33* \\
\S2.4: 1*,2,3*,11*,12,13 \\

%Additionally, we'll be using iPython Notebooks for several assignments
%in the class. Most of you seem comfortable with what we've done in
%class. The following is due on Tuesday the 26th at 5:00 PM, to give
%you time to ask questions. I'll get you set up on our cluster on
%Friday the 22nd.

%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Use a \texttt{for} loop to evaluate the first 4 partial sums of one of the series from the previous problems.
