Problem 1: Show that $e^{z_1}e^{z_2} = e^{z_1+z_2}$ via power series expansions.\\

Problem 2: Use graphical techniques to multiply $\left[6e^{i\pi}\right]\left[3e^{\left(3\pi/2)i\right)}\right]$.\\

Problem 3: Write the general form for the following two series, and determine the disks of convergence.

\begin{equation*}
1 + iz + \frac{2(iz)^2}{2!} + \frac{3(iz)^3}{3!} + ...
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
1 + iz + \frac{(iz)^2}{2!} + \frac{(iz)^3}{3!} + ... \ .
\end{equation*}\\

Problem 4: (\S2.10 15) Find all values of $\sqrt[6]{-64}$.\\

Problem 5: (\S2.10 27,28) Using the fact that the complex equation is really two real equations, find the double angle formulas (for $\sin2\theta$, $\cos2\theta$) as well as the triple angle formulas  (for $\sin3\theta$, $\cos3\theta$). \\

Problem 6: Find $e^{2+i\pi}$ in rectangular form. \\

Problem 7: Express the following integral in exponential form and then integrate $\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\cos^2(2x)dx$. \\

Problem 8: Express the following in rectangular coordinates: $3^i$, $(-1)^i$, $(2i)^{(i+1)}$.
