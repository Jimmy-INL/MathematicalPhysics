\section{Fourier Transforms}
Boas \S7.12 \#1, 4, 10
\\
Related to \#4 and 10, you may do \#13 and 19 for extra credit.

\section{Laplace Transforms}
Boas \S8.8 \#2, 8
\\
Boas \S 8.9 You may do \#4 and 19 for extra credit, assuming they're
familiar from last semester.

\section{Convolutions}
Boas \S 8.10 \#3
\\
Additional (required) problem: Pick two functions of your own choice,
calculate the convolution, graph both functions and the convolution,
explain whether it makes sense graphically.

\section{Delta functions}
Boas \S 8.11 \#20 (only need to verify 11.19 parts d and e), 21

\section{Green's Functions}

Read Boas \S 8.12 example \#2 (p. 463), do problem \#11
