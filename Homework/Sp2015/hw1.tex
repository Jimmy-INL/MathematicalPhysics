\noindent\textbf{Assignment 1, Due Monday}
\vskip.15in

The main goal of this part of the class is to get familiar with the
mechanics of working with series and complex numbers. So, this
assignment includes many short problems. The selection below is a good
one to get you acquainted with the techniques. The starred problems
are the ones you're required to turn in (there are ten of them).

\noindent\S1.10: 1*,2*,3,4,5 \\
\S1.12: 1* \\
\S1.13: 5ab, 7ab*, 9ab, 10ab, 20* \\
\S1.14: 3* \\
\S1.15: 33* \\
\S2.4: 1*,2,3*,11*,12,13 \\

Additionally, we'll be using iPython Notebooks for several assignments in the class.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Work through the first three Software Carpentry Python Lessons: 
\\http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/python/index.html
  \item Use a \texttt{for} loop to evaluate the first 4 partial sums of one of the series from the previous problems.
\end{itemize}
