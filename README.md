Mathematical Physics
===================

Course material from my mathematical physics class and related info

# Prerequisites

* The two-day Python Bootcamp, led by
  [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) hosted on
  Earlham's campus, January 11-12, 2015 (that's the Sunday/Monday
  before Spring classes, so housing should not be a problem). The
  ability to build and tweak simple computational models *greatly*
  expands the types of questions you can ask (and answer!) by
  yourself. We will use a series of
  [IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)
  throughout the semester, and this two-day bootcamp will teach you
  all the Python you need to get started right away. Students with
  previous Python experience can discuss opting out with the
  instructor. Students who absolutely cannot make it to the Bootcamp
  can discuss working independently with the instructor to catch up
  very early on in the semester.

# Convolutions

Our notebook on convolutions may be found [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mglerner/MathematicalPhysics/blob/master/Convolutions/Convolution%20Animations.ipynb)

# Resources for Independent Projects #


## Bayesian Estimation ##

   * [Bayesian Estimation w/ PyMC and IPCluster](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/wakari_demo/ipcluster_mcmc?has_login=False)

## FFT ##

    * "The Fast Fourier Transform and Its Applications" by E. Oran Brigham, 1998, ISBN 10: 0133075052 / ISBN 13: 9780133075052

## More advanced Noether's Theorem ##

    * Terry Tao's blog entry from
      [March 2014](http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2014/03/02/noethers-theorem-and-the-conservation-laws-for-the-euler-equations/)

## Normal mode analysis ##

    * Should be able to use some of John's material for a very nice stock project, then ENM models as an extension.
