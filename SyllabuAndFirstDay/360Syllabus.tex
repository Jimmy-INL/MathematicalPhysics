\item[Recommended Textbooks] \hfill \\
%\textbf{Boyce and DiPrima, Elementary Differential Equations and BVPs}
%This was the differential equations book last year. We'll either use
%parts of it or refer to your current book.
\textbf{Boyce and DiPrima, Elementary Differential Equations and BVPs}
This was the differential equations book last semester. You'll need it
again this semester.\\
\textbf{The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Volume II}
This has some very nice explanations of the vector calculus concepts
that we'll be covering, taken from a physicist's perspective. This
part of Feynman is also extremely conversational and readable. While
every self-respecting scientist should, of course, own a hard copy,
you can read the whole thing online with beautiful typesetting at
http://www.feynmanlectures.info/ \\
\textbf{Gelfand and Fomin, Calculus of Variations}
The best introduction I know of to calculus of variations. It's an
\$11 Dover paperback. \\
\textbf{Emmy Noether's Wonderful Theorem} by Dwight E. Neuenschwander
will be the basis for our discussion of Noether's Theorem. This book
is really well written, and goes much farther than we'll have time
for. \\
\textbf{Kusse and Westwig, Mathematical Physics}
This text is extremely well written. It doesn't have quite the right
focus for this particular class. \\ 
\textbf{Arfken and Weber, Mathematical Methods for Physicists}
This encyclopedic volume makes for a good reference, but is a bit too
dry to learn from in this course. \\ 
\textbf{Schey, div grad curl and all that}
This is an extremely conversational introduction to/refresher on vector calculus \\

\noindent\textbf{Prerequisites, co-requisites, etc.}\footnote {Please contact the instructor if you're considering taking 350 as a co-requisite. Doing so requires that I carefully coordinate my syllabus with whoever happens to be teaching 350 at the time.}
\begin{description}
\item[Prerequisite] Math 320, differential equations.
\item[Prerequisite] Math 350, multivariate calculus. With instructor consent, this may be a co-requisite.
\item[Strongly Suggested] Physics 125, analytical physics I.
\item[Suggested] Math 310, linear algebra. Really, this makes everything easier.
\end{description}
 
This class has, in some iterations, spent a week covering \textbf{infinite series} (Boas sections 1.1-1.8). This year, we will assume that students are sufficiently familiar with those topics as they were covered in Math 280. \textbf{If this is not the case, let me know as soon as possible}.

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Course Goals}: One of the great strengths of a modern physics background is that it allows you to address problems in an enormous range of fields, from physics itself to economics, biology, ecology, computer science, complex systems, physical chemistry, geology, and engineering. The primary objective of this course is to provide a systematic introduction to mathematical techniques that will serve you both in future physics courses and in modeling interesting problems in your domain of choice. A significant secondary objective is to develop a level of mathematical sophistication that will allow you to confidently and competently explore further material on your own.

As might be gathered from the preceding paragraph, a significant fraction of the results of modern scientific research can only be accurately expressed in the language of advanced mathematics. A glance at any of the most prestigious scientific journals in your field of interest will quickly confirm this. Thus, even experimental scientists or those interested primarily in field work need to achieve a certain degree of mathematical sophistication if they are to understand the conceptual foundation and interpretation of research results in their own fields. This course is intended to provide you with a working knowledge of those techniques most commonly encountered in science and engineering. In the process of learning these techniques, you will also acquire experience in the physical interpretation of mathematical models of physical problems.

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Structure} There will be three class meetings each week. The class meetings will generally consist of lectures, discussion of assignments, and student presentation of assigned problems.

It is very important that students study the appropriate text assignments before coming to class and that they be prepared either to ask questions or to discuss questions related to the assigned material.  The subject matter of this course is sufficiently complex that it is neither desirable nor possible to cover all relevant details in class.  The primary value of lectures and class discussions in this course is to explain and illustrate points which students find difficult or obscure.  It is essential, therefore, that students put in the advance work required to identify such points; the instructor cannot anticipate all of them.  It is hoped that all of us will work together to produce a class atmosphere which is conducive to lively and interesting discussions of the material.


\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Tests}: There will be three midterms and a final. The mini-midterm will be open-book and untimed. The other tests will be timed and closed-book. All will be self-scheduled exams, to be picked up and turned in at the front desk of the science library.

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Homework}: This is basically a course in
problem-solving techniques.  The most common and the most damaging
mistake a student can make in such a course is to yield to the
temptation to try and master the material by reading the text and
listening to the lectures while working a minimum of problems.  While
reading and listening can give you valuable new ideas, problem-solving
skills are only efficiently developed by solving as many problems as
possible.  For most students the understanding and knowledge gained
from this course will be in direct proportion to the number of
problems which they successfully complete.  The best approach is to
maximize the percentage of your study time devoted to a disciplined
effort to solve problems.

Homework will be assigned each approximately once per week. As with
all Physics classes, you will find that your understanding is greatly
improved if you start the assignments early in the week, rather than
late in the week.

You get five free late days. After that, each additional weekday that
an assignment is late will result in a deduction of a full letter
grade for that assignment.

Grading policy: several of the problems assigned in this class are
quite challenging. Others are just rote computation. For the more
challenging problems, my goal is to have you make the strongest
possible effort towards \textbf{understanding} the solution. Thus, if
you cannot fully solve the problem, say whatever you can about the way
in which a solution would proceed from where you stop; say whatever
you can about the qualitative behavior of a solution; say whatever you
can about the physical meaning of the solution. 

Homework problems will be graded on roughly the same scale as used in
Physics 125 and 235:

\begin{description}
  \item[5] Solution is complete and well-written
  \item[4] Solution is missing minor parts or some important explanations
  \item[3] Solution is missing major parts and/or has few if any explanations
  \item[2] At least one major portion of the problem correct
  \item[1] Very little coherent initial effort was expended
  \item[0] No initial solution was submitted
\end{description}

\vskip.15in
\noindent\textbf{Independent project}: The primary goals of this course are involve developing a level of mathematical sophistication that will allow you to confidently and competently explore further material outside of a lecture setting. So, in order to make sure we're walking the walk, you'll each pick either an interesting problem to model or an interesting technique to learn. You'll write a short paper and present the results to the class. You'll be expected to start on this halfway through the semester, and we'll discuss it in more detail at that point. Examples might include

\begin{itemize}
  \item The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
  \item Physical representations of Fourier Transforms, including circuits and optics
  \item The discrete Fourier Transform, including application to time series data, consideration of how many useful samples you have in a dataset in Fourier space, etc.
  \item Struve functions
  \item Complex analysis including itegrating around poles, Cauchy Integral, Residue theorem
  \item Tensors, covariant vs. contravariant, pseudo-vectors, index notation
  \item Black-Scholes Theorem (economics)
  \item Applications of Noether's Theorem to economic systems
  \item Modern techniques such as the immersed-boundary method
  \item Coding and examination of more complex numerical integrators
  \item Green-Kubo relations and the Fluctuation Theorem
  \item Wavelet Transforms
  \item Real world applications of any of the techniques studied in this course
  \item Interesting topic of your choice!
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note}: If there is sufficient demand, it is likely possible to include at least one of the above topics in the main body of the course itself.
